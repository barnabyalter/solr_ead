        Series VIII: Miscellaneous, 1960, contains a single issue of the pocket magazine <title render="italic">OPAL</title>, from Pride Publications (Cleveland, Ohio). The staff of <title render="italic">OPAL</title> included Valena M. Williams, executive editor; John Bentley, art director; and Nathaniel Hubbard, circulation manager. Volume 1, issue 5 includes work by photographers James Gayle, Anderson Marlow, and Harvey Bowie; columnists Bill Clark, Harrison Dillard, Edward Jones, William Matlock, and Mary Zachary; and artwork by cartoonist Ted Walker. It is possible one of the photographs in the magazine could be by Baynes, but none are cited as such. The publication contains information from members of the local community on birthday celebrations and other upcoming events, contest winners, and fashion, as well as longer articles on jazz, the importance of education and peaceful protests, the influence of disc jockeys and popular music on teens, WJMO's middle school student disc jockeys, singer Nancy Wilson, and Isabelle Cooley, co-star of the feature film <title render="italic">I Passed for White</title>.
